# Hospital Management Web Application

## Abstract: 
Here,I have developed an website for RUET Medical Center as this was an academic project that had done on the 3rd year Odd semester.
A medical center is a very important place for any institution. Students and
teachers along with the staff need to have access to this place always because any
time a mishap can happen. For bigger accidents, calling ambulances becomes
necessary. So a website can ensure all these. Contact information for an
ambulance and also consulting available doctors become easier. So, we chose to
design this website so that everybody gets easy access to RUET medical center.
## Objective:
To help everyone get access to RUET medical center anytime online so that
getting medical help from here gets easier
